# Kourtneys-Weather-Dashboard

The title of this project is Kourtneys-Weather-Dashboard. The reason why this project is so important is because it will showcase my knowledge of Javascript to prospective employers.

HOW IT WORKS: When the user enters the program, they are presented with an option to search for any city in the world.

After clicking the 'search' button, the user is presented with the searched city, current date and weather conditions, the 5-day forecast, as well as historical search results.

Searched city with current date and conditions:

5-day forecast:

Historical Search results:

Once the search results hit 5, any search result after that will start replacing what was previously searched. For example, if I searched for: Minneapolis, London, Lebanon, Portland, Houston

and then started searching for something different, in this case, Washington. The city of Washington will replace the oldest search result which, in this case was Minneapolis
